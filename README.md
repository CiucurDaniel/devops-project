# devops-project

This showcases an example configuration with Terraform code and Kubernetes deployments in order to have a production like setup that I can quickly spin-up and test onto.

Currently this is a `work in progress`.

# Goal

The main goal is to have a setup I can practice my skill on (Terraform/Kubernetes/Azure/DevOps).

Secondary this should server as a guide on how we can organize our Terraform code, our Kubernetes manifests and other resources.
